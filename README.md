# BSides 25 badge

## Hardware

* ESP32-C3FH4 (4MB flash) with WiFi and Bluetooth
* 128x64 px OLED display (SSD1306)
* 16 WS2812B (Neopixel compatible) LEDs
* USB-C for flashing/charging

[Schematics](./hardware/BSides_2025_badge_v1.1_schematics.pdf)

## Software

The code in `software` is written in MicroPython and loaded onto the badge via USB-C connector.

Update the code by uploading via `mpremote` or directly via some IDE like [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). If you go [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) route, you might want to check Python (ms-python.python), Pylance (ms-python.vscode-pylance), MicroPico, Micropython IDE, MPRemote / ESPTool wrappers, GitLens, EditorConfig, Bracket Pair Colorizer / Rainbow Brackets, Tabnine / Copilot extensions.

## Device preparation

```
brew install pipx python wget
pipx ensurepath
pipx install esptool
pipx install mpremote
pipx install pytest
mkdir -p ~/Downloads/mp && cd ~/Downloads/mp
wget https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/ESP32_GENERIC_C3-20250911-v1.26.1.bin
```
After that use flash_badge.sh for Format and Install and sync_badge.sh for just updating the files.

If the code is already running on the badge and `mpremote` does not connect, hold `SELECT` button down while resetting your badge (pressing `RESET` button or toggling ON/OFF switch).


### Badge setup utilities

From the "Badge setup" menu on the device you can:

* Fetch your display name from the registration service.
* Scan for nearby WiFi networks â€“ the list refreshes automatically after a scan completes, and you can press `SELECT` to trigger another scan if needed.
* View the Git repository URL for the firmware.

## Snake Game Fork

This fork adds a fully playable snake game to the BSides badge menu.

BACK - Back to the menu  

## Home Assistant integration

Create a file named `homeassistant.json` in the root of the badge filesystem to enable the optional MQTT integration.  When Wi-Fi credentials are supplied the badge will connect automatically, publish Home Assistant discovery information, and expose the LED ring as a controllable light entity.  If you would like the bridge to reuse the built-in BSides SSID/password, set `"use_defaults": true` inside the `wifi` block; otherwise the bridge waits for an existing connection (for example, one initiated from the Fetch Name workflow).

Example configuration:

```
{
  "wifi": {
    "ssid": "MyWiFi",
    "password": "supersecret"
  },
  "mqtt": {
    "broker": "192.168.1.10",
    "port": 1883,
    "username": "ha",
    "password": "ha-pass",
    "discovery_prefix": "homeassistant"
  }
}
```

To use the default BSides Wi-Fi credentials instead of providing your own SSID, supply an empty `wifi` block with `"use_defaults": true`.

```
{
  "wifi": {
    "use_defaults": true
  },
  "mqtt": {
    "broker": "192.168.1.10"
  }
}
```

Once connected, Home Assistant will show a light entity named after the badge ID.  The entity supports on/off, brightness, hue/saturation colour control and selecting any of the badge's LED effects.  Remote changes are persisted to `params.json`, while on-device adjustments immediately update the entity state.

## Testing

To run the MicroPython-oriented unit tests on a development machine, use:

```bash
./run_tests_badge.sh -q
```

The script wraps `pytest` and sets up stubbed hardware modules so the badge firmware can be exercised without Wi-Fi hardware.
