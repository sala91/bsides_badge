[Schematics](./hardware/BSides_2025_badge_v1.1_schematics.pdf)

## Software

The code in `software` is written in MicroPython and loaded onto the badge via USB-C connector.

Update the code by uploading via `mpremote` or directly via some IDE like [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).

## Device preparation

Install `esptool` and `mpremote`
```
pip install --user esptool mpremote
```

Install [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/download/ESP32_GENERIC_C3).

For BSides 2025: v1.26.1 (2025-09-11)
```
wget https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/ESP32_GENERIC_C3-20250911-v1.26.1.bin
esptool --port <port> erase_flash
esptool --port <port> --baud 921600 write_flash 0 ESP32_GENERIC_C3-20250911-v1.26.1.bin
```

## Copy files to the badge

```
mpremote <port> fs cp -r software/* :/
```

If the code is already running on the badge and `mpremote` does not connect, hold `SELECT` button down while resetting your badge (pressing `RESET` button or toggling ON/OFF switch).

### Badge setup utilities

From the "Badge setup" menu on the device you can:

* Fetch your display name from the registration service.
* Scan for nearby WiFi networks â€“ the list refreshes automatically after a scan completes, and you can press `SELECT` to trigger another scan if needed.
* View the Git repository URL for the firmware.

### Home Assistant integration

Create a file named `homeassistant.json` in the root of the badge filesystem to enable the optional MQTT integration.  The badge will automatically connect to WiFi (falling back to the BSides SSID/password when no custom credentials are provided), publish Home Assistant discovery information, and expose the LED ring as a controllable light entity.

Example configuration:

```
{
  "wifi": {
    "ssid": "MyWiFi",
    "password": "supersecret"
  },
  "mqtt": {
    "broker": "192.168.1.10",
    "port": 1883,
    "username": "ha",
    "password": "ha-pass",
    "discovery_prefix": "homeassistant"
  }
}
```

Once connected, Home Assistant will show a light entity named after the badge ID.  The entity supports on/off, brightness, hue/saturation colour control and selecting any of the badge's LED effects.  Remote changes are persisted to `params.json`, while on-device adjustments immediately update the entity state.
